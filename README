Welcome to VJQuery.

This project is built on top of Versant JPA, to serve two purposes:
a) provide an example of the Versant JPA Generic API
b) provide a handy, command line browser for Versant JPA databases

I'll start with the basics and will provide new features based on
feedback and my own needs ;-)

Enjoy!
